# OpenGL in Nim

~~I have just realized just how stupid this is. I am spending more time dealing
with Nim than I am with learning OpenGL.~~

I have decided to fix this issue by simply relying entirely on Nim. I don't know
how I am going to deal with CGLM. Right now I want to catch up with my C implementation
of the OpenGL tutorial by Joey de Vries.

I got to a point in which I can draw a simple blue triangle.

## TODO

- [x] drop nimGL
- [x] drop nimPNG
- [ ] add cglm
